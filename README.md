# 🚗 Traffic Volume Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the volume of traffic using various machine learning models. It uses a real-world dataset containing traffic data collected from sensors.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Trafficvolumeprediction ml project.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, model training and evaluation.
- 📊 **Algorithms used**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest

## 📌 Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Model Training & Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
- Feature Importance Visualization

## 📉 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:
- **Date/time columns**: Time of traffic measurement
- **Weather-related features**: Temperature, rain, snow, etc.
- **Target**: `traffic_volume` (number of vehicles in an hour)

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Results

Among all models tested, the **Random Forest Regressor** gave the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy.

## 🧠 Use Case

Useful for:
- Urban traffic management
- Predictive analysis for smart city planning
- Transportation scheduling
